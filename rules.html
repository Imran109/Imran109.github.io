    <h4>This game is still in development , some of the real rules of the game may not be included in this. </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
                Blackjack may be played with one to eight decks of 52-card decks.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
                Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to pip value, and tens and face cards count as ten points. In this game we count Ace to be only 1 point!

       </li><br>
       <li>After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up. The facedown card is called the "hole card."</li>
       <br>
       <li><span style="font-weight: bolder" >Stand:</span> Player stands pat with his cards.
        </li><br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bolder" >Hit:</span> Player draws another card (and more if he wishes). If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 (known as "breaking" or "busting") then he loses.
